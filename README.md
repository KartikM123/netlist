# netlist 
## v.0.0
netlist, a tag based network cli app.

this app allows you to set tags for individuals, store information for them, and then read that information at scale. It's a great organizing tool that measures how long it's bene since you last talked with someoneone.

recommendations:
- be picky about tags you have --> try to minimize them
- app works best when try to give each person 1 tag. Networks should be focused anways!
- embrace the tag and organize feature to it's max
- explore how to configure the template.json to add in your own custom configurations
